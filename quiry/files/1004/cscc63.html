<P>Welcome CSC C63 students!

<P>This page contains course information.
 Assignments and annoucements from the course are found on
 <A HREF="http://portal.utoronto.ca/">Blackboard-portal</A> (html).
 You are responsible for knowing all the material from this page and its
 associated pages.
 In particular, you are responsible for reading all messages
 (announcements, advice and questions & answers regarding course work).
 You must check for such messages regularly, at least once every four days.

<H3>Web Option - Value-Added Model</H3>
Lectures from this course will be videotaped and made available for a
limited time.
See
<A HREF="https://lecturecast.utsc.utoronto.ca/">WebOption Lecturecasts</A>
(html).

<P>You are here to learn.
Learning is a process which includes attending and interacting in classes.
Learning is not some product purchased with your tuition (like class
notes).
Offering the web option is meant to allow you to listen and participate
more actively while in class.
<I><U>It does not allow you to skip classes</U>.</I>
<B>Indeed if it should happen that nobody shows up to a class, then the
class will not be recorded, but you will still be responsible what would
have been taught.</B>

<HR><CENTER><H2>Learning at the edge, <I>active</I> tutorials</H2></CENTER>

According to this
 <A HREF="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~nick/pyramid.docx">"pyramid"
 slide</A> (docx) about retention after learning, the best way to learn
something well is to practice by doing and by teaching others.
Research also shows that students learn best <I>at the edge</I> of their
knowledge or ability.
Applied to this course, it means an optimal way to learn course material is
for you to do course work (answer questions or solve problems) under the
guidance of a teacher.

<P>Accordningly, tutorials in this course are conducted with the
expectation that students are more active than passive.
Each week you will be given some questions to answer and/or problems to
solve, and you are expected to work on these during tutorial, either on
your own or in a group.
Your TA will be there, <I><U>but only to guide you if you get
stuck, not to give you answers or solutions</U></I>.
<B>This means you need to be actively working on the given questions and
problems to fully benefit from tutorials.</B>
It also means you should prepare for tutorials by reviewing material from
relevant lectures and notes.

<HR><CENTER><H2>Online discussions</H2></CENTER>

<P>We will also have online discussions, in which students post problems
with solutions, and critique each other's work.
Here are the goals of such discussions.
<UL>
<LI>Create lots of examples.
 <BR><I>How good the examples are depends on how much effort is put into
 them by the students.</I>
<LI>Earn some (relatively) easy marks.
<LI>Learn some course material.
 <BR><I>Like so many things in life, how much one gets out of this depends
 on how much one puts into it.</I>

<H3>Texts</H3>

<H4>Required textbook</H4>
<UL>
<LI><a href="http://www-math.mit.edu/~sipser/book.html">Introduction to the
 Theory of Computation -- third edition</a> (html); by Michael Sipser.
 Two copies are available at the library for short term loan.
 It is also possible to use the second edition of this book.
 However, all references, including page numbers, exercises and problems,
 will refer to the third edition.
 So you may need to check with someone who has a third edition sometimes.
 <BR>You're expected to be already familiar with material from chapters 0
 to 2 (from cscB36).
 We'll be covering chapters 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8.
 We may also cover some of chapters 6 and 10.
<LI>We will also frequently refer to
 <A HREF="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~nick/cscC63/additional-notes/">these
 additional notes</A> (html).

<H3>Goals for the Class</H3>
We have two goals for this course.
<OL>
<LI>Every student earns a passing mark.
<LI>At least 75% of the class earns a mark of A or B (70 or better).
</OL>
I hope you will work to achieve these goals as much as I will.

<H3>Collaborative Learning</H3>
<I>Collaborative Learning</I> may be defined as studying and working within
 a group environment in a way that benefits everyone.
 Research shows that students can learn more material more deeply and retain
 what they learn longer if they work in a group setting.
 Throughout the course, you will be given opportunities and encouraged to
 work collaboratively, help each other learn, and thus fare better.
 Examples include tutorial work, online discussions, and assignments, where
 work for these is intended to be done collectively.

<P>We hope to achieve our goals above with the help of collaborative
 learning.

<H3>Grading Scheme</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Two term tests (see notes #1 and #2 below); weight: <B>36%</B>.
<LI>Two online discussions (see note #3 below); weight: <B>14%</B>.
<LI>Assignments contribution (see note #4 below); weight: <B>10%</B>.
<LI>Final exam; weight: <B>40%</B>.
</UL>

<P><B>Note #1:</B> Your best test will have weight 24%, and your worst test
will have weight 12%.

<P><B>Note #2:</B> If you miss one of the two tests for an acceptable
reason, then you will be given a choice of two options.
<OL>
<LI>You may choose to take a makeup test, which will be an oral test and
 guaranteed to be harder than the original test (since you will have more
 time to study).
 <BR>The makeup test must occur within one week of the original test.
<LI>You may choose to use your final exam mark as your test mark.
</OL>
The second option is not available if you miss a second test, whatever the
reason.
Your final exam cannot have a weight over 70%.
 
<P><B>Note #3:</B> These discussions will take place on
<A HREF="http://portal.utoronto.ca/">Blackboard-portal</A> (html).
For each discussion you will create and post two problems along with their
solutions, and you will critique and give a grade to each of four such
problem/solution pairs posted by your classmates.
<!--

 led by a TA on
 For these discussions, we're looking for you to demonstrate your grasp
 (and learning) of relevant course material.
 In grading your work, we'll be looking for breadth as well as depth, and
 quality will be at least as important as quantity.
 If you're unable to solve a particular problem or present a correct
 solution, you may still show your knowledge by making suggestions as to
 how an answer could be obtained.
 Sometimes this is what "real" theoretical computer scientists do when they
 hold discussions.
-->
 As with any work submitted for academic credit, your submissions to these
 discussions must be your own work.
 You must adhere to the policy on plagiarism (see below).

<P><B>Note #4:</B> Assignments in this course are not individually
 submitted to be marked.
 Instead they are to be completed collectively by the class as a whole on
 discussion board forums on
 <A HREF="http://portal.utoronto.ca/">Blackboard-portal</A> (html).
 Indeed these assignments are too long for most students to complete on
 their own.
 <UL>
 <LI>Assignments contribution is a measure of how much you contribute
  positively to the completion of course assignments.
 <LI>Positive contribution does not necessarily mean a correct answer.
  Incorrect answers can be helpful in illustrating what not to do, thereby
  showing others what errors to avoid.
  This is one of the benefits of collaborative learning.
 <LI>On the other hand posting a solution when a similar solution has
  already been posted is considered negative contribution.
  So check to see if someone else has already posted something similar
  before submitting a post.
 <LI>In general your assignments contribution mark will be the weighted
  average of the rest of your marks.
  However, if your computed course mark falls just below a GPA change
  boundary (e.g., 49 or 84), then your assignments contribution mark may be
  used to adjust your course mark accordingly.
  Here are two examples.
  <UL>
  <LI>Suppose you earn 72/90 on your term tests, online discussions and
   final exam.
   Then technically your assignments contribution mark will be 8/10
   (= 72/90).
   Whether you actually made any assignments contribution is irrelevant
   here.
  <LI>Suppose you earn 68.4/90 on your term tests, online discussions and
   final exam.
   Then your assignments contribution mark will be 7.6/10 (= 68.4/90).
   This gives you a course mark of 76, which is just below a GPA boundary
   (between B and B+), so your actual assignments contribution will be
   considered.
   Your mark will be bumped up to 77 (B+) if you are deemed to have made
   enough positive assignments contribution.
  </UL>
 <LI>Past experience shows that about half the students whose computed
  course mark fell just below a GPA boundary were "bumped up" as a result
  of this.
  The other half did not contribute positively to the assignments, so alas,
  their grade point remained the same.
 </UL>

<H3>Fixing marks - the Power Adjustment</H3>
Once in a while (we hope never), the class as a whole fares very poorly on
a test.
In such a case, the marks will be adjusted.
Frequently, something I call <I>power adjustment</I> will be used.
Here's how it works.
<P>A student's mark of m out of T will be adjusted to (m/T)^p *T [still
out of T], where p is some real number where 0 < p < 1.
Put another way, the mark is converted to a fraction between 0 and 1
(that's the m/T part), which is taken to the power p (that's the ^p part),
then finally converted back to a mark out of T (that's the *T part).
Note that adjustments increase in size as p decreases.

 Work posted after them will not be graded.

<H3>Policy on Term Tests</H3>
All requests for re-marking of tests must be made in writing to the
 instructor on the day the quizzes are returned.
 If you write in pencil, or if your quiz has any sign of things having been
 erased, then you forfeit all rights of having your quiz re-marked.
 If we re-mark your quiz, we reserve the right to re-mark your whole quiz,
 not just the part you requested, and you may end up with a lower mark than
 what you were originally given.

<H3>Policy on Plagiarism</H3>
Every year, we encounter students who claim they do not think they
 committed an academic offence when they clearly did.
 Please read this
 <A HREF="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~nick/cheating.html">
 page on plagiarism</A> (html)
 very carefully.
