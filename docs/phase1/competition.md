Similar existing products include other search engines such as [Google](https://www.google.com/), [Bing](https://www.bing.com/), and [Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/). However those search engines indexes the entire internet and would return results from other universities. Since our users would primarily be from UTSC, searching through a database of files uploaded by other students and instructors from UTSC would return results more relevant to our users. These big-name search engines were developed to be used by the general population and therefore did not focus on a specific subset of people, which is what our product is designed to do.

Other websites exist to help students learn more efficiently and earn higher grades. [Course Hero](https://www.coursehero.com/) and [OneClass](https://oneclass.com/) allow people from different universities across the world can upload their course notes for others to study. However because the site requires a payment to access other people's notes, whereas our product is availble for free and offers more than just in-class notes, our product provides resources closer to the material students are studying at UTSC, and may be struggling financially .

There are other products similar to ours on a smaller scale such as the University of Toronto old exams repository, which stores exams from all 3 campuses and allows its users to search for past exams from various courses, but it is limited to exam papers. Our product would allow users to upload more than just old exams, such as lecture notes, past assignments and research papers.

#TODO: add section about uploading academic papers
