# Competition
--------------------

Similar existing products include other search engines such as [Google](https://www.google.com/), [Bing](https://www.bing.com/), and [Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/). Those search engines index the entire internet and would return results from other universities. Since our users would primarily be from UTSC, searching through a database of files uploaded by other students and instructors from UTSC would return results more relevant to our users. These big-name search engines were developed to be used by the general population and therefore does not focus on a specific subset of people, which is what our product is designed to do.

Other websites exist to help students learn more efficiently and earn higher grades. [Course Hero](https://www.coursehero.com/) and [OneClass](https://oneclass.com/) allow people from different universities across the world can upload their course notes for others to study. However, because the site requires a payment to access other people's notes, whereas our product is available for free and offers more than just in-class notes, our product provides resources closer to the material students are studying at UTSC, and may be struggling financially.

Also requiring subscriptions are digital libraries that host a variety of books or research papers. That could be your local library website, the publisher's website, or portals of certain organizations. Common textbook publishers include [Cengage Learning](https://www.cengage.com/) or [Pearson Education](https://etext.pearson.com/), and research papers may be found in the [ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/). While we understand that we cannot directly compete with those websites due to copyright restrictions, public domain free content are still valuable additions to our database.

There are other products similar to ours on a smaller scale such as the University of Toronto [Old Exams Repository](https://exams-library-utoronto-ca.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/), which stores exams from all three campuses and allows its users to search for past exams from various courses, but it is limited to exam papers. Our product would allow users to upload more than just old exams, such as lecture notes, past assignments and research papers.

Similar to sites like [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca)and [Academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/), our product will also provide a platform for users to search through indexed research papers, journals, and other scholarly literature. Unlike Google Scholar and Academia.edu, our product will only index literature uploaded through the site by University of Toronto instructors and students. Also unlike Academia.edu, users can search academic literature without having to create an account or signing in to the website. However, University of Toronto instructors may specify access of their own papers to University of Toronto students or instructors only.

All the competitors' products listed above were built to serve specific purposes that may partially overlap with our target audience. Our goal is clear and focused: make our search engine the only place someone needs to search for academic content from UTSC. We believe our envisioned product will be better suited to serve users from UTSC.
