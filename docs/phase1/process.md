# Process

#TODO: add group photo here
#TODO: Reflect on how your team worked together.
#TODO: How did you organize the team? 

There were 6 different deliverables for this phase of the project. We assigned a few people to complete most of each deliverable. 

1. [summary.md](../summary.md) : Wayne
2. [competition.md](../competition.md) : Mak, Jack
3. Personas : Jack (Instructor), Mak (Student), Wayne (Guest)
4. [user_stories.md](../user_stories.md) : Kin, Jack
5. UI/UX : Yash, Mak
6. [process.md](../process.md) : Wayne

Everyone was able to make suggestions or changes to the documents as they are being completed. Decisions were made collectively, where the majority (at least 3 people) must approve the final version for submission.

We worked collaboratively in 2 group meetings on Wednesday and Friday, 3 hours each. All documents were stored online, so everyone could have access to work individually. Text (md) files were modified directly in the Bitbucket [team repository](../). Other binary files, where a PDF had to be generated, were created in a [shared folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Vp_EavrXJuBndS51qNz5HwQQOdFwQoiO) on Google Drive. The UI/UX mockups were designed using [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/).

#TODO: add more tools used on the project

Our user stories are prioritized based on need. Core functionalities to a search engine, including the backend, are the highest priority; they are also illustrated in our UI/UX mockups. Features that enhance user experience (such as sorting or grouping the results) are the next priority, while add-on features that are not related to search are lower priority (such as favorites or user comments). We will consider additional features, if required, to be an extension to the scope of this project.

#TODO: What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?
