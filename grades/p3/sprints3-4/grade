Comments: There is a lot of work remaining in your project. Your team has potential to deliver a great project. 
However, it is important that your team now starts to accelerate and integrate and put everything together. 
If you have any questions, please do stop by my office hours on Mondays or Fridays, and I can provide more guidelines
if required.
