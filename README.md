## Development
The main project is located in the [quiry](quiry/) directory. It is developed using:

* [Java SE Development Kit 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) (Latest Update 172)
* [Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/oxygen3a) (Latest version Oxygen 4.7.3a)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) (Latest version 3.5.3)

The [java](java/) directory shall contain sample test Java projects intended to test individual features before they are ready to be included in the main project.

These coding [guidelines](http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~alundblad/styleguide/index-v6.html) will be enforced.

## Contributing
Quick steps to contributing to this project:

1. Create your branch in JIRA with the sprint number followed by the issue (sub-task) ID (`s#-TEAM11-##`)
2. Include the JIRA issue ID in the commit message (`git commit -m "TEAM11-## ..."`)
3. Push changes to the branch (`git push -u origin s#-TEAM11-##`)
4. Create a [__pull request__](https://bitbucket.org/mcs2/csc01teamprojectrepo11/pull-requests/) to master by the end of the week

For more details, see:

* [Referencing issues in your development work](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwarecloud/referencing-issues-in-your-development-work-777002789.html)
* [Using Smart Commits](https://confluence.atlassian.com/fisheye/using-smart-commits-298976812.html)

You may append a tag to the end of the branch name to indicate its purpose. For example: `feature`, `develop`, `bugfix`, `release`.

Do __NOT__ commit any binary or temporary files generated by the IDE or OS. A sample [.gitignore](quiry/.gitignore) file can be found in the quiry project.

## Marking
Please remember to [log](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiracoreserver073/logging-work-on-issues-861257349.html) any days you worked on tasks in [JIRA].

A screenshot of the task board will be taken _three_ times a week, on Monday, Thursday, and Sunday.

The previous sprint will end at __9:00p__ every Sunday. A weekly summary of the Burndown chart will be generated. New tasks will be assigned for the next sprint during the weekly meeting.

All work-in-progress __must__ be merged to master by the end of each sprint. At least _two_ people other than the author need to approve the pull request before the branch can be merged. Create a new branch following the procedure listed above to continue working.
