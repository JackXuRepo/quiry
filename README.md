## Development
The main project is located in the [quiry](quiry/) directory. It is developed using:

* [Java SE Development Kit 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) (Latest Update 172)
* [Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/oxygen3a) (Latest version Oxygen 4.7.3a)
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) (Latest version 3.5.3)

The [java](java/) directory shall contain sample test Java projects intended to test individual features before they are ready to be included in the main project.

These coding [guidelines](http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~alundblad/styleguide/index-v6.html) will be enforced.
